You are given a string `s` that contains some bracket pairs, with each pair containing a non-empty key.

For example, in the string `"(name)is(age)yearsold"`, there are two bracket pairs that contain the keys `"name"` and `"age"`.
You know the values of a wide range of keys. This is represented by a `2D` string array `knowledge` where each `knowledge[i] = [key_i, value_i]` indicates that key `key_i` has a value of `value_i`.

You are tasked to evaluate all of the bracket pairs. When you evaluate a bracket pair that contains some key `key_i`, you will:

Replace `key_i` and the bracket pair with the key's corresponding `value_i`.
If you do not know the value of the key, you will replace `key_i` and the bracket pair with a question mark `"?"` (without the quotation marks).
Each key will appear at most once in your `knowledge`. There will not be any nested brackets in `s`.

Return the resulting string after evaluating all of the bracket pairs.

Example 1:

```
Input: s = "(name)is(age)yearsold", knowledge = [["name","bob"],["age","two"]]
Output: "bobistwoyearsold"
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "hi(name)", knowledge = [["a","b"]]
Output: "hi?"
```

Example 3:

```
Input: s = "(a)(a)(a)aaa", knowledge = [["a","yes"]]
Output: "yesyesyesaaa"
``` 

Constraints:

```
1 <= s.length <= 105
0 <= knowledge.length <= 105
knowledge[i].length == 2
1 <= key_i.length, value_i.length <= 10
s consists of lowercase English letters and round brackets '(' and ')'.
Every open bracket '(' in s will have a corresponding close bracket ')'.
The key in each bracket pair of s will be non-empty.
There will not be any nested bracket pairs in s.
key_i and value_i consist of lowercase English letters.
Each key_i in knowledge is unique.

**Problem Statement**

There is a bag that consists of items, each item has a number `1`, `0`, or `-1` written on it.

You are given four non-negative integers `numOnes`, `numZeros`, `numNegOnes`, and `k`.

The bag initially contains:

`numOnes` items with `1`s written on them.
`numZeroes` items with `0`s written on them.
`numNegOnes` items with `-1`s written on them.
We want to pick exactly `k` items among the available items. Return the maximum possible sum of numbers written on the items.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: numOnes = 3, numZeros = 2, numNegOnes = 0, k = 2
Output: 2
```

Example 2:

``
Input: numOnes = 3, numZeros = 2, numNegOnes = 0, k = 4
Output: 3
```

Constraints:

```
0 <= numOnes, numZeros, numNegOnes <= 50
0 <= k <= numOnes + numZeros + numNegOnes
```
